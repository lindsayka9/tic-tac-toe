# TIC-TAC-TOE Game

https://lindsayka9.github.io/tic-tac-toe/index.html

This is a two player, sign-on tic-tac-toe game, where both users play against each other in the same browser. Player 1 is represented by 'X', while player 2 is represented by 'O'. Players will switch off clicking in game boxes, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

This site was built with:
* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS
* AJAX
* JSON
* jQuery

I strategized the making of the game by first gathering all the information I needed to understand how the API worked, and what information my code would need to pass over. My first step was creating the actual board and getting the authorization portion working. I then made sure I could mark on the board with the appropriate token when a user clicks on a game box. Finally, I confirmed that games would be saved in the API, and I was able to call up a statistic of how many finished games a user had played.

In future iterations of the game, I would be interested in adding more statistics to call back, such as total games played, games lost, and games won.

User Stories:
* As a user I would like to sign in to play the game.
* As a user I would like to sign off when I'm done.
* As a user I would like to start a new game.
* As a user I would like to put pieces on the game board.
* As a user I would like the game to switch between X and O on each turn.
* As a user I would like to see how many games I've finished.

There are minor differences in the layout of this wireframe, but the functionality I was planning for is all the same.
